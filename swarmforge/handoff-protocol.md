# Handoff Daemon Proposal

## Goal

Replace direct agent access to the tmux socket with a daemon-owned file transport.
Agents should not send tmux commands, manage socket permissions, or maintain a
separate logbook. Agents should create small, validated handoff requests; the
daemon should deliver them through durable inbox files and send only wake-up
notifications through tmux.

## Summary

The swarm startup script starts a handoff daemon alongside the tmux session. The
daemon has direct access to the tmux socket and watches each agent worktree for
outbound handoff files. When an outbound handoff appears, the daemon validates
delivery targets, copies the handoff into each recipient inbox, sends each
recipient a generic tmux wake-up message, and moves the original outbound file
to `sent` or `failed`.

The recipient inbox is the task queue. Agents use helper scripts to accept and
complete inbox items. Queue state is represented by file location, and audit
timestamps are stored in the handoff file headers.

## Directory Layout

Each agent worktree owns this structure:

```text
.swarmforge/handoffs/
  outbox/
    tmp/
  sent/
  failed/
  inbox/
    new/
    in_process/
    completed/
```

The daemon consumes `outbox/`. Agents consume `inbox/new/` through helper
scripts. The `sent`, `failed`, `in_process`, and `completed` directories provide
the audit trail and restart state.

## Role Receive Mode

`swarmforge.conf` window lines may include an optional receive mode:

```text
window <role> <agent> <worktree> [task|batch] [extra-cli-args...]
```

When omitted, receive mode defaults to `task`. Any fields after the receive
mode are passed to the agent CLI as additional arguments. The launcher writes the
normalized mode into `.swarmforge/roles.tsv`, and agent-facing receive helpers
read that runtime file rather than reparsing `swarmforge.conf`.

Use `batch` for roles that should consume equal-priority queued handoffs as a
single unit, such as six-pack `cleaner`, `architect`, `hardender`, and `QA`,
and four-pack `architect`.

## Filename Format

Handoff filenames should sort by priority, timestamp, and sequence:

```text
<priority>_<timestamp>_<sequence>_from_<sender>_to_<recipient-list>.handoff
```

Example:

```text
00_20260615T140531Z_000042_from_architect_to_coder_cleaner_QA.handoff
```

Rules:

- Lower priority numbers are processed first.
- `priority` is two digits from `00` through `99`.
- `timestamp` is UTC in `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` format.
- `sequence` is a per-worktree counter that breaks ties for handoffs created
  in the same second.
- Recipients remain in the filename for audit.
- Structural filename fields are separated with underscores.
- Scripts parse authoritative metadata from file headers, not from the filename.
- Startup validation should reject role names containing underscores so recipient
  lists remain readable in audit filenames.

## Handoff File Format

Handoff files use a simple header block, a blank line, and a generated body.
Scripts may update headers, but the body is opaque after creation.

The `id` header is globally audit-oriented and should include timestamp,
sequence, and sender:

```text
<timestamp>_<sequence>_from_<sender>
```

Including the sender prevents otherwise identical timestamp/sequence pairs from
colliding across worktrees. The sequence update must be serialized inside each
worktree so concurrent handoff creation cannot reuse the same sequence.

Example delivered handoff:

```text
id: 20260615T140531Z_000042_from_coder
from: coder
to: cleaner
recipient: cleaner
priority: 50
type: git_handoff
role: coder
task: task-1-cave-setup
commit: a1b2c3d9
created_at: 2026-06-15T14:05:31Z
enqueued_at: 2026-06-15T14:05:32Z

Re-read your role and constitution.

merge_and_process coder a1b2c3d9
```

For broadcast handoffs, `to` preserves the full recipient list and `recipient`
identifies the specific recipient copy.

## Message Types

Agents may request only two message types.

### `git_handoff`

Used when a role has committed work for another role to merge and process.

Draft:

```text
type: git_handoff
to: cleaner
priority: 50
task: task-1-cave-setup
commit: a1b2c3d9e8
```

Generated body:

```text
Re-read your role and constitution.

merge_and_process coder a1b2c3d9
```

The script validates the task name and canonicalizes the commit abbreviation
before queuing the handoff. The task name is a short, stable human-readable
name that follows the work through downstream git handoffs for the same task.

#### Chain forwarding

Intermediate roles in a pack pipeline must always forward a `git_handoff` to
the next role in the chain after completing the inbound task, regardless of
what changed. Manifest-only, audit-only, generated metadata, formatting-only,
and other non-functional churn still require a forward down the chain.

Examples:

- `two-pack`: `coder` -> `cleaner` -> `coder`; `cleaner` always forwards to
  `coder`.
- `four-pack`: `specifier` -> `coder` -> `refactorer` -> `architect` ->
  `specifier`; each intermediate role always forwards to the next role in the
  chain.
- `six-pack`: `specifier` -> `coder` -> `cleaner` -> `architect` -> `hardender`
  -> `QA`; each intermediate role always forwards to the next role in the
  chain.

#### Terminal broadcast

Only the end-of-chain handoff sent to multiple recipients is not forwarded
further. Each recipient merges that commit (`merge_and_process`) and stops;
recipients do not re-forward that handoff down the chain.

Examples:

- `two-pack`: when `cleaner` sends the return handoff to `coder`, `coder`
  merges only.
- `four-pack`: when `architect` sends the return handoff to `specifier`,
  `specifier` merges only.
- `six-pack`: when `QA` sends the completion handoff to the other roles, each
  recipient merges only.

### `note`

Used for one short freeform message.

Agents should not send `note` handoffs unless the user, role prompt, or
constitution explicitly directs them to send one. When blocked by ambiguity,
contradiction, or test/specification conflict, an agent should stop and ask for
clarification instead of sending a `note` handoff unless one of those explicit
authorities directed that note.

Draft:

```text
type: note
to: architect,QA
priority: 70
message: Waiting on QA result before merging cleanup branch.
```

Generated body:

```text
Re-read your role and constitution.

Waiting on QA result before merging cleanup branch.
```

The `message` value must be a single line no longer than 80 characters.

## `swarm_handoff.sh`

`swarm_handoff.sh` should be the strict outbound protocol gate.

Proposed usage:

```sh
swarm_handoff.sh ./tmp/handoff.txt
```

Responsibilities:

- Read a draft handoff file.
- Validate all fields and emit detailed repair guidance for malformed drafts.
- Reject reserved headers supplied by agents.
- Infer `from` from the current agent/worktree.
- Validate `to` against configured agents.
- Generate `id`, `created_at`, filename timestamp, and sequence.
- Serialize sequence updates with an atomic lock so concurrent handoff creation
  in one worktree cannot reuse the same sequence.
- Validate `priority` as `00` through `99`.
- Validate `type` as `git_handoff` or `note`.
- Validate `git_handoff` commits as real, unambiguous commits.
- Canonicalize valid commit abbreviations.
- Generate `role` from the current sender role for `git_handoff`.
- Preserve `task` from the draft for `git_handoff`.
- Generate the canonical body.
- Atomically install the completed file into `outbox/`.

Atomic outbound write sequence:

1. Write the generated handoff to `outbox/tmp/<filename>.tmp`.
2. Flush and close the file.
3. Rename it to `outbox/<filename>.handoff`.

The daemon should ignore `outbox/tmp/` and process only final `.handoff` files
that appear directly under `outbox/`.

Reserved headers:

```text
id
from
role
recipient
created_at
enqueued_at
dequeued_at
completed_at
```

Validation errors should be explicit enough for an agent to repair the draft.

Example error:

```text
HANDOFF INVALID: ./tmp/handoff.txt

Errors:
- Line 3: `priority` must be two digits from 00 to 99; got `urgent`.
- Header `completed_at` is reserved and must not be written by agents.
- message: commit `a1b2c3` is ambiguous; use at least 9 characters.

Expected git_handoff format:

type: git_handoff
to: cleaner
priority: 50
task: <short-stable-task-name>
commit: <commit-abbrev>
```

## Commit Validation

For `git_handoff`, `swarm_handoff.sh` should validate the commit abbreviation
with Git.

Rules:

- The commit abbreviation must be hexadecimal.
- It must be exactly 10 characters.
- It must resolve to exactly one object.
- The resolved object must be a commit.
- The script should write a canonical abbreviation into the queued handoff.

This prevents agents from sending corrupted or ambiguous SHA abbreviations.

## Handoff Daemon

The daemon should be implemented in Babashka.

Rationale:

- The service is mostly filesystem traversal, parsing, sorting, renaming, and
  subprocess calls.
- Babashka keeps the implementation small and easier to change while the
  protocol is still evolving.

Responsibilities:

- Discover configured agents and worktrees.
- Poll each agent `outbox/`.
- Process only complete `.handoff` files, never files in `outbox/tmp/`.
- Copy each handoff to every recipient `inbox/new/`.
- Add `recipient` and `enqueued_at` to each recipient copy.
- Send a generic tmux wake-up message to each recipient.
- Move the original outbox file to `sent/` after successful delivery.
- Move malformed or undeliverable files to `failed/` with useful diagnostics.
- Avoid duplicate delivery when retrying after interruption.

The tmux message should not name the delivered file. It should avoid biasing the
recipient toward one file and should force queue-order processing.

Example tmux wake-up:

```text
You have new handoff mail. If idle, run ready_for_next.sh.
```

## Queue Helper Scripts

Agents should not manually move inbox files. Helper scripts should own queue
state transitions.

### `ready_for_next.sh`

Responsibilities:

- Run inside one agent worktree.
- Read the current role from `SWARMFORGE_ROLE`.
- Read that role's receive mode from `.swarmforge/roles.tsv`.
- Dispatch to `ready_for_next_task.sh` for `task` mode.
- Dispatch to `ready_for_next_batch.sh` for `batch` mode.

### `done_with_current.sh`

Responsibilities:

- Run inside one agent worktree.
- Read the current role from `SWARMFORGE_ROLE`.
- Read that role's receive mode from `.swarmforge/roles.tsv`.
- Dispatch to `done_with_current_task.sh` for `task` mode.
- Dispatch to `done_with_current_batch.sh` for `batch` mode.

### `ready_for_next_task.sh`

Responsibilities:

- Run inside one agent worktree.
- Check `inbox/in_process/` first.
- If an in-process file exists, report that it must be resumed or completed
  before accepting new work.
- If no in-process file exists, select the first file in `inbox/new/` by sorted
  filename order.
- Atomically move that file to `inbox/in_process/`.
- Add or update `dequeued_at`.
- Print the accepted task path, sender, message type, priority, and payload.
- Print `NO_TASK` if no inbox item is available.
- Refuse ambiguous states, such as multiple in-process files, unless an explicit
  repair is made outside the helper.

Example success:

```text
TASK: .swarmforge/handoffs/inbox/in_process/00_20260615T140531Z_000042_from_architect_to_coder.handoff
FROM: architect
TYPE: git_handoff
PRIORITY: 00
TASK_NAME: task-1-cave-setup
PAYLOAD:
Re-read your role and constitution.

merge_and_process architect a1b2c3d9
```

### `done_with_current_task.sh`

Responsibilities:

- Run inside one agent worktree.
- Require exactly one file in `inbox/in_process/`.
- Refuse to run if `inbox/in_process/` contains a batch directory.
- Add or update `completed_at`.
- Move the file to `inbox/completed/`.
- Print the completed task path.
- Call `ready_for_next_task.sh` after completion and pass through its output.
- Refuse to run if there are zero or multiple in-process files, unless an
  explicit repair is made outside the helper.

`done_with_current_task.sh` should not duplicate queue-selection logic.
`ready_for_next_task.sh` should remain the single owner of checking
`inbox/in_process/`, selecting the next sorted `inbox/new/` item, moving it to
`inbox/in_process/`, adding `dequeued_at`, and printing `TASK` or `NO_TASK`.

### `ready_for_next_batch.sh`

Responsibilities:

- Run inside one agent worktree.
- Check `inbox/in_process/` first.
- If an in-process batch exists, print that batch.
- Refuse to run if a single in-process task exists.
- If no in-process work exists, select the first file in `inbox/new/` by sorted
  filename order.
- Select every queued handoff with the same priority as that first file.
- Move those files into one `inbox/in_process/batch_<timestamp>_<suffix>/`
  directory.
- Add or update `dequeued_at` on each selected file.
- Print the accepted batch path, count, priority, and each task payload in
  helper-delivered order.
- Print `NO_TASK` if no inbox item is available.
- Refuse ambiguous states, such as multiple in-process batches, unless an
  explicit repair is made outside the helper.

### `done_with_current_batch.sh`

Responsibilities:

- Run inside one agent worktree.
- Require exactly one batch directory in `inbox/in_process/`.
- Refuse to run if `inbox/in_process/` contains a single task file.
- Add or update `completed_at` on each file in the batch.
- Move the batch directory to `inbox/completed/`.
- Print the completed task paths and completed batch path.
- Call `ready_for_next_batch.sh` after completion and pass through its output.
- Refuse to run if there are zero or multiple in-process batches, unless an
  explicit repair is made outside the helper.

Example success:

```text
COMPLETED: .swarmforge/handoffs/inbox/completed/00_20260615T140531Z_000042_from_architect_to_coder.handoff
TASK: .swarmforge/handoffs/inbox/in_process/50_20260615T140600Z_000043_from_cleaner_to_coder.handoff
FROM: cleaner
TYPE: note
PRIORITY: 50
PAYLOAD:
Re-read your role and constitution.

Waiting on QA result before merging cleanup branch.
```

Example success with no queued follow-up:

```text
COMPLETED: .swarmforge/handoffs/inbox/completed/00_20260615T140531Z_000042_from_architect_to_coder.handoff
NO_TASK
```

## Agent Queue Rules

Prompts should instruct agents to follow this loop:

1. When notified, run `ready_for_next.sh`.
2. Let `ready_for_next.sh` dispatch according to the receive mode configured for
   your role.
3. If it prints `NO_TASK`, stop waiting for work.
4. If it prints `TASK: <path>`, treat the printed `PAYLOAD` as the task.
5. If it prints `BATCH: <path>`, treat each printed `BATCH_ITEM` as part of the
   current batch in helper-delivered order.
6. Use only the task information printed by the helper scripts.
7. If a tmux wake-up arrives while already working on a task, ignore it.
8. When the task or batch is fully complete, run `done_with_current.sh`.
9. Treat `note` handoffs as tasks too; after reading or acting on a note, run
   `done_with_current.sh` before accepting any other handoff.
10. If a done helper prints `TASK: <path>`, treat the printed `PAYLOAD` as the
   next task.
11. If a done helper prints `BATCH: <path>`, treat each printed `BATCH_ITEM` as
   part of the next batch in helper-delivered order.
12. If a done helper prints `NO_TASK`, stop waiting for work.

On restart, an agent should run `ready_for_next.sh` and follow its output.

Tmux wake-ups are intentionally lossy. They only prompt an idle agent to check
its durable inbox. A busy agent can ignore them because task completion also
checks the queue and accepts the next task in priority order.

## Audit Trail

The file system state and handoff headers replace the logbook.

Important headers:

```text
id
from
to
recipient
priority
type
created_at
enqueued_at
dequeued_at
completed_at
```

Lifecycle ownership:

- `swarm_handoff.sh` writes `id`, `from`, `to`, `priority`, `type`, and
  `created_at`.
- `handoffd` writes `recipient` and `enqueued_at` into each recipient copy.
- `ready_for_next_task.sh` writes `dequeued_at`.
- `ready_for_next_batch.sh` writes `dequeued_at`.
- `done_with_current_task.sh` writes `completed_at`.
- `done_with_current_batch.sh` writes `completed_at`.

## Daemon Shutdown

The swarm launcher should own the daemon lifecycle.

Startup:

- Start the daemon after creating or discovering the tmux session.
- Write daemon runtime files under `.swarmforge/daemon/`.

Runtime files:

```text
.swarmforge/daemon/
  handoffd.pid
  handoffd.log
  stop
```

Shutdown:

- When the swarm is torn down, the launcher sends `TERM` to the daemon.
- The daemon traps `TERM`, finishes any current delivery transaction, removes
  its PID file, logs shutdown, and exits.
- The daemon may also watch `.swarmforge/daemon/stop` as a secondary shutdown
  mechanism.

Delivery should be transaction-like:

1. Detect an outbox file.
2. Copy it to all recipient inboxes.
3. Send wake-up notifications.
4. Move the original outbox file to `sent/`.
5. If interrupted before completion, retry without duplicating already delivered
   recipient copies.

## Implemented Helpers

The current daemon-backed protocol uses these helper scripts:

- `swarm_handoff.sh` validates and queues outbound handoff drafts.
- `ready_for_next.sh` dispatches to the correct ready helper for the current
  role's configured receive mode.
- `done_with_current.sh` dispatches to the correct done helper for the current
  role's configured receive mode.
- `ready_for_next_task.sh` accepts or resumes one current task.
- `done_with_current_task.sh` completes one current task.
- `ready_for_next_batch.sh` accepts or resumes one current batch.
- `done_with_current_batch.sh` completes one current batch.
- `handoffd` delivers queued outbox files and sends generic wake-ups.

Agents should not use direct tmux notifications, long handoff bodies, logbooks,
or the removed send/receive/complete/resend wrapper scripts.

## Finalized Decisions

- The handoff daemon is written in Babashka.
- Git handoff commit abbreviations are exactly 10 hexadecimal characters.
- `note` handoffs have no optional classification field.
- Helper scripts do not provide recovery modes for ambiguous queue state.
- The daemon does not perform a second full validation pass on outbox files;
  `swarm_handoff.sh` is the validation boundary.
